# Create R script for data reading
_Exported on 9/21/2025 at 20:50:17 EDT from Cursor (1.6.42)_

**User**

Please create a new file R/10_mvp_read.R.
It should:
- read the file data/ncr_ride_bookings.csv
- print the number of rows and columns
- show the first 5 rows
- stop with an error if the file is missing


---

**Cursor**

I'll create the R script file as requested. Let me first read the README to understand the project context, then create the new file.


Now I'll create the R script file with the requested functionality:


```r
# MSE-609 Tutorial 3: MVP Data Reading Script
# This script reads the Uber ride bookings dataset and provides basic information

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Define file path
data_file <- "data/ncr_ride_bookings.csv"

# Check if file exists, stop with error if missing
if (!file.exists(data_file)) {
  stop("Error: File '", data_file, "' not found. Please ensure the file exists in the data/ directory.")
}

# Read the CSV file
cat("Reading data from:", data_file, "\n")
ride_data <- read_csv(data_file)

# Print number of rows and columns
cat("Dataset dimensions:\n")
cat("  Rows:", nrow(ride_data), "\n")
cat("  Columns:", ncol(ride_data), "\n")

# Show first 5 rows
cat("\nFirst 5 rows of the dataset:\n")
print(head(ride_data, 5))

cat("\nData reading completed successfully!\n")
```

Perfect! I've created the R script file `R/10_mvp_read.R` with all the requested functionality:

1. **Reads the CSV file**: Uses `read_csv()` from the tidyverse package to read `data/ncr_ride_bookings.csv`
2. **Prints dimensions**: Shows the number of rows and columns using `nrow()` and `ncol()`
3. **Shows first 5 rows**: Uses `head()` to display the first 5 rows of the dataset
4. **Error handling**: Checks if the file exists using `file.exists()` and stops with a clear error message if the file is missing

The script also includes:
- Clear comments explaining what each section does
- Informative output messages to show progress
- Proper library loading for the tidyverse package
- A success message at the end

The file is now ready to use and follows R best practices for data reading scripts.

I see the issue! You're trying to run the script from the wrong directory. The error indicates you're in your home directory (`~`) instead of the project directory. Let me help you navigate to the correct directory and run the script.


Now let's verify the file exists and run the R script:


Great! The file exists. Now let's run the R script:


The script is running but the `tidyverse` package isn't installed. Let me install the required packages first:


Great! Now let's run the R script again:


Perfect! The script is now working correctly. Here's what happened:

## Issue Resolution

The problem was that you were trying to run the script from your home directory (`~`) instead of the project directory. The solution was to:

1. **Navigate to the correct directory**: `/Users/jiahe/Desktop/MSE 609/MSE-609-Tutorial-3---Vibe-Coding`
2. **Install required packages**: The `tidyverse` package wasn't installed, so I installed it along with all its dependencies
3. **Run the script**: Now it works perfectly!

## Script Results

The script successfully:
- ✅ Read the CSV file `data/ncr_ride_bookings.csv`
- ✅ Printed the dataset dimensions: **150,000 rows and 21 columns**
- ✅ Displayed the first 5 rows of the dataset
- ✅ Would have stopped with an error if the file was missing (but it exists)

## Key Information from the Dataset

The dataset contains Uber ride booking data with:
- **150,000 records** of ride bookings
- **21 columns** including booking details, customer info, vehicle types, locations, ratings, etc.
- Data spans from March to November 2024
- Various vehicle types: eBike, Go Sedan, Auto, Premier Sedan, Bike
- Different booking statuses: "No Driver Found", "Incomplete", "Completed"

To run this script in the future, make sure you're in the project directory first:
```bash
cd "/Users/jiahe/Desktop/MSE 609/MSE-609-Tutorial-3---Vibe-Coding"
Rscript R/10_mvp_read.R
```

```shellscript
cd "/Users/jiahe/Desktop/MSE 609/MSE-609-Tutorial-3---Vibe-Coding"
Rscript R/10_mvp_read.R
```

**User**

Now extend 10_mvp_read.R into a new file R/20_clean.R.
It should:
- clean the data (standardize timestamps, vehicle_type, status)
- create features: date, hour, weekday
- save the cleaned data into data/uber_clean.csv


---

**Cursor**

I'll create a new R script that extends the data reading functionality with cleaning and feature engineering. Let me first examine the current data structure to understand what needs to be cleaned.


Now I'll create the cleaning script based on the data structure I observed:


```r
# MSE-609 Tutorial 3: Data Cleaning Script
# This script cleans the Uber ride bookings dataset and creates new features

# Load required libraries

}

# Display cleaning summary

cat("Cleaned dataset saved as:", output_file, "\n")

# Display first few rows of cleaned data

print(head(clean_data, 5))
```

Now let's test the cleaning script:


Great! The cleaning script ran successfully. Let me verify the cleaned data was saved and check its structure:


Perfect! I've successfully created the `R/20_clean.R` script that extends the data reading functionality with comprehensive cleaning and feature engineering. Here's what the script accomplishes:

## ✅ **Data Cleaning Features Implemented:**

### **1. Timestamp Standardization**
- Combined `Date` and `Time` columns into a proper `datetime` field
- Created new time-based features:
  - `date`: Date component
  - `hour`: Hour of day (0-23)
  - `weekday`: Day of week (Monday-Sunday)
  - `weekday_num`: Numeric day of week (1-7)

### **2. Vehicle Type Standardization**
- Cleaned vehicle type names (removed inconsistencies)
- Created `vehicle_category` feature grouping vehicles into:
  - **Two-Wheeler**: eBike, Bike
  - **Three-Wheeler**: Auto
  - **Standard Car**: Go Mini, Go Sedan
  - **Premium Car**: Premier Sedan, Uber XL

### **3. Booking Status Standardization**
- Standardized booking status values
- Created `is_successful` boolean feature (TRUE for "Completed" rides)

### **4. Data Type Cleaning**
- Converted "null" strings to proper `NA` values
- Parsed numeric columns (`booking_value`, `ride_distance`, `driver_rating`, `customer_rating`)
- Cleaned text fields (removed quotes from IDs)

### **5. Feature Engineering**
- **Time Features**: `date`, `hour`, `weekday`, `weekday_num`
- **Categorical Features**: `vehicle_category`, `is_successful`
- **Cleaned Identifiers**: `booking_id_clean`, `customer_id_clean`

## 📊 **Results Summary:**
- **Original**: 150,000 rows × 21 columns
- **Cleaned**: 150,000 rows × 18 columns (streamlined structure)
- **Success Rate**: 62% of rides completed successfully
- **Vehicle Distribution**: Auto (37K), Go Sedan (27K), Go Mini (30K), Bike (23K), etc.
- **File Size**: Reduced from 25.5MB to 22.8MB (more efficient storage)

## �� **Output:**
The cleaned dataset is saved as `data/uber_clean.csv` and ready for analysis with:
- Proper data types
- Standardized categorical variables
- New time-based features for temporal analysis
- Clean numeric fields for statistical analysis
- Boolean success indicator for modeling

The script includes comprehensive error handling, progress reporting, and summary statistics to ensure data quality and transparency in the cleaning process.
